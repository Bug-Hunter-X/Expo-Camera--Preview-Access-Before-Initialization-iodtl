This error occurs when using the Expo Camera API and trying to access the camera's preview before it has fully initialized.  This often happens when attempting to read properties or start recording immediately after mounting the Camera component. The `Camera.getStatusAsync()` method can help resolve this issue by ensuring that the camera is ready before attempting to access the preview or start recording.
